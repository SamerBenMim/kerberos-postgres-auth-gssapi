# kerberos-postgres-auth-gssapi
This project showcases the setup and configuration of a Kerberos authentication system between a client, a Postgres server, and a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The client can securely authenticate to the Postgres server using Kerberos tickets obtained from the KDC, enabling SSO (Single-Sign-On) access to the database. The project includes three virtual machines: the KDC, the Postgres server, and the client, and demonstrates how to configure each of them to establish a secure connection using Kerberos.
